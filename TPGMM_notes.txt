- Try to make each sample its own size instead of making them all of same size [Can't! because the algorithm creates a tensor to represent the data before learning the GMM]
- Do DTW to make all samples the same size
- Make the TPGMM train over pose_error  (add 4th dimension to _Data.txt of the samples)
- Find where the training-over-datatype (either time or pose_error) is defined in the code

AFter getting the Mu and Sigma in 3D:
- Either -> convert them to a format so that the gmm_gmr ros node can read it and visualize it in Rviz
      OR -> plot the GMM (elipses) in python TPGMM package, but will have to double check the regression!
